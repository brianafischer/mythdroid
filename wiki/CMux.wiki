#summary Details of MDD's Connection Muxer

== MDD CMux ==

The MDD Connection Muxer module allows MythDroid to make connections to the 
various (MDD and backend related) services it needs through a single TCP 
connection (on port 16550/tcp). This is useful if you are using !MythDroid 
remotely via an SSH connection since you only have to setup SSH port 
forwarding for a single port.

!MythDroid will automatically use CMux if it's available and if it thinks 
you are connecting remotely via SSH. 

By default CMux will only permit connections to TCP ports 6543, 6544, 16546 
and 16547 for mythbackend, MDD and VLC's rc interface.

CMux can be configured in [MDDConf mdd.conf], where it is possible to disable 
CMux and add to the list of permitted ports.
