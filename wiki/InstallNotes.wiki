!MythDroid 0.4 supports MythTV 0.21 - 0.24 and trunk.

==MythTV Configuration==

You must enable the 'Enable frontend network control' option in each frontend's general settings.

==MDD==

MDD extends the functionality of !MythDroid signficantly. See [MDD here] for more information, including installation notes.

==MythTV 0.22 Specific Notes==

MythTV 0.22 has some bugs in the network control feature. Apply [http://mythdroid.googlecode.com/files/myth-netcontrol-2.patch this patch] so that !MythDroid is able to initiate recording playback properly. 

The bugs were fixed by MythTV rev 23381 so users of MythTV 0.23 or above need not apply any patches. 

==MythTV 0.21 Specific Notes==

For the program guide viewer to function correctly, you must apply [http://mythdroid.googlecode.com/files/xml-guide.patch this patch] to the MythTV 0.21 fixes source code.

Once you have checked out a copy of release-0-21-fixes, apply the patch like so:

{{{
cd /path/to/release-0-21-fixes
patch -p1 < xml-guide.patch
}}}

and then follow the normal steps to configure, build and install MythTV.
