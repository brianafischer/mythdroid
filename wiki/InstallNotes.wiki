#summary Notes on installation of MythDroid

==MythTV Version==

!MythDroid currently supports the MythTV 0.21-fixes branch. 

==Program Guide Patch==

For the program guide viewer to function correctly, you must apply [http://mythdroid.googlecode.com/files/xml-guide.patch this patch] to the MythTV 0.21 fixes source code.

Once you have checked out a copy of release-0-21-fixes, apply the patch like so:

{{{
cd /path/to/release-0-21-fixes
patch -p1 < xml-guide.patch
}}}

and then follow the normal steps to configure, build and install MythTV.

==MDD==

mdd is a perl program that, once installed on a frontend, provides mythdroid with extended
functionality. This includes 'push' updates for TV remote, more detail about current location in Nav remote and song information in Music remote. To install mdd, download it to a frontend and run it as root:

{{{
perl /path/to/mdd-0.1.pl
}}}

For mdd to function, you must ensure that the following settings in the LCD page under Setup -> Appearance are enabled on the frontend:

 * Enable LCD device
 * Display time
 * Display menus
 * Display music artist and title (items = Artist - Title) 
 * Display channel information

mdd will check these settings during installation and let you know if you need to take action.

==Installation==

You can install !MythDroid to your device either by checking out the source code (via Eclipse with the [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ SubClipse] and [http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r3/installing.html#installingplugin Android ADT] plugins), connecting your device and running !MythDroid on it or by downloading the latest [http://mythdroid.googlecode.com/files/MythDroid-0.1.apk MythDroid APK] and using adb (from the Android SDK) or an application from the Android Market to install it.
