== Streaming ==

Streaming of recordings and video is performed via MDD on the backend, which uses ffmpeg and vlc to transcode and stream the media. For this to work, you'll need [http://mythdroid.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mdd/mdd MDD from trunk], ffmpeg and vlc installed on your backend.

In !MythDroid, stream a recording or video by selecting "Here" from a frontend chooser (found by long pressing a recording or video or the 'play' button in a recording or video detail page).

Transcoding the video requires a hefty cpu on the backend; a reasonable dual-core is probably the minimum. 

No controls (except volume) are implemented - you can't pause, seek, etc. If anyone has any ideas about this, let us know.

You should be able to stream any recording or video that ffmpeg can demux and decode (dvds ripped to iso won't work). If you have problems, check /tmp/ffmpeg.out and/or /tmp/vlc.out for more information.
